Explanation:

1. input("Enter expression: ")

This prompts the user to enter a math expression (like 2 + 3 * 4).

The input is taken as a string.



2. eval(...)

eval() evaluates the string as a Python expression.

So if the user enters "2 + 3 * 4", eval() calculates it as 2 + 3 * 4 = 14.



3. print(...)

This simply prints the result of the evaluated expression.

Note: Be careful with eval() â€” it's powerful but can be dangerous if used with untrusted input. For safer alternatives, let me know!
